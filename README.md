The following are the Specifications:
.Research the Google Books Volume API to determine how to search for books given a query. You will need to create an API key.
.Build a basic search engine for Google Books. There should be a search bar to input a query that will be be passed as an argument to the Google Books API. The results should be rendered in the results area. You must include these fields (if available for the record):
 -Cover image
 -Title
 -Subtitle
 -Authors
.Additionally, each result should somehow provide a link to its respective Google Books page. Look at a Google Books entry on Google Books, and see which parameter might help you.
.Each subsequent query should append or prepend its results to the results area.
.There must be no duplicates (by Google Books id).
.The results should be visually appealing, styled logically, and fully responsive for mobile devices.
